## About ## 

A simple Java program which allows you to simulate [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It allows the user to select a grid size, manually "kill" or "birth" cells, step through generation by generation, or just let it run continuously. Will your species stabilize or go extinct?
